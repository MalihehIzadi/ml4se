## General description

Software repositories archive valuable software engineering data, such as source
code, execution traces, historical code changes, mailing lists, and bug reports.
This data contains a wealth of information about a project's status and history.
Doing data science on software repositories, researchers can gain empirically
based understanding of software development practices, and practitioners can
better manage, maintain, and evolve complex software projects.

In the recent years, the advances in Machine Learning and AI technologies,
as demonstrated by the successful application of Deep Neural Networks in various
domains [did not go unnoticed](https://github.com/src-d/awesome-machine-learning-on-source-code)
[in the field of Software Engineering](https://ml4code.github.io/papers.html).
Researchers have applied DNNs to tackle issues such as automated program
repair, code summarization, code completion, code structure representation, etc.

IN4334 is a seminar course that aims to give students a _deep_ understanding of
and hands-on approach on how deep neural networks and NLP techniques a
